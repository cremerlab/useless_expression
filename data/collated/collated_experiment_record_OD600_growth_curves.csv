2021-07-19_r1_WT_glucose,Rejected,"Experiment was an instrument test and not a formal experiment. 
"
2021-07-20_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment appears to have been successful. It looks like the wild-type  strain is growing slightly faster than usual, though. 
"
2021-07-21_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment appears to have been successful with no aberrant results. 
"
2021-07-22_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment looks good, save for the growth rate of ∆flh, which is notably slower than in other experimental runs in the same conditions. The saturating  optical density is also lower for this mutant than in all other runs.
"
2021-07-23_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"All data looks good. One replicate (r1 of ∆glt) was dropped and  due to contamination and another few points of ∆mgl r3 were dropped as obvious instrument error. 
"
2021-07-25_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"All data looks good with no reason to reject
"
2021-07-26_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks okay with no obvious pathology. The steady-state phase seems  to be ""wiggly"", albeit to a small degree. I will accept this with  some consideration. REplicate 3 of the ∆dpp sample had to be dropped  due to instrument error.
"
2021-07-26_r2_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. The growth of ∆opp was very noticeably reduced ocmpared to  all other replicates, so it was dropped from this data set. 
"
2021-07-27_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. Replicate 3 of the ∆pot strain was dropped due to a higher  initial OD and a long lag phase, making isolation of the exponential phase  more difficult
"
2021-07-27_r2_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. Replicate 1 of ∆rbs was dropped due to an obvious instrument  error where there was a sudden largee drop in the OD, but growth  continued as normal.
"
2021-07-28_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good and there is nothing of note in this experiment. 
"
2021-08-06_r1_WT_water_comparison_acetate,Rejected,"Experiment was to identify a potential contamination in the water source and is not a final experimental measurement. 
"
2021-08-11_r1_WT_proline,Rejected,"Experiment was exploratory in nature and should not be used for further analysis
"
2021-08-12_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"No reason to doubt the data and the experiment proceeded without issue.  
"
2021-08-12_r2_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good and nothing is suspect 
"
2021-08-13_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Rejected,"Experiment is ongoing
