experiment,status,description
2021-07-19_r1_WT_glucose,Rejected,"Experiment was an instrument test and not a formal experiment. 
"
2021-07-20_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment appears to have been successful. It looks like the wild-type  strain is growing slightly faster than usual, though. 
"
2021-07-21_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment appears to have been successful with no aberrant results. 
"
2021-07-22_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment looks good, save for the growth rate of ∆flh, which is notably slower than in other experimental runs in the same conditions. The saturating  optical density is also lower for this mutant than in all other runs.
"
2021-07-23_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"All data looks good. One replicate (r1 of ∆glt) was dropped and  due to contamination and another few points of ∆mgl r3 were dropped as obvious instrument error. 
"
2021-07-25_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"All data looks good with no reason to reject
"
2021-07-26_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks okay with no obvious pathology. The steady-state phase seems  to be ""wiggly"", albeit to a small degree. I will accept this with  some consideration. REplicate 3 of the ∆dpp sample had to be dropped  due to instrument error.
"
2021-07-26_r2_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. The growth of ∆opp was very noticeably reduced ocmpared to  all other replicates, so it was dropped from this data set. 
"
2021-07-27_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. Replicate 3 of the ∆pot strain was dropped due to a higher  initial OD and a long lag phase, making isolation of the exponential phase  more difficult
"
2021-07-27_r2_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. Replicate 1 of ∆rbs was dropped due to an obvious instrument  error where there was a sudden largee drop in the OD, but growth  continued as normal.
"
2021-07-28_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good and there is nothing of note in this experiment. 
"
2021-08-06_r1_WT_water_comparison_acetate,Rejected,"Experiment was to identify a potential contamination in the water source and is not a final experimental measurement. 
"
2021-08-11_r1_WT_proline,Rejected,"Experiment was exploratory in nature and should not be used for further analysis
"
2021-08-12_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"No reason to doubt the data and the experiment proceeded without issue.  
"
2021-08-12_r2_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good and nothing is suspect 
"
2021-08-13_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Experiment went without any problems and the data looks good. 
"
2021-08-13_r2_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. There is some jitter in points for ∆flh ∆rbs, but not enough  to do anything about.  
"
2021-08-14_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"The experiment looks fine. There may be a problem with one of the replicates of the ∆his ∆glt run, but it's not severe enough to discount the run altogether as  the growthr ates are mostly comparable with previous runs.   
"
2021-08-16_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good, save for replicate 1 of ∆opp ∆rbs which had an obvious  instrument error. This replicate was dropped from the analysis
"
2021-08-17_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Experiment looks good without any hiccups that matter for the growth rate inference. 
"
2021-08-17_r2_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good and there's no reason not to accept the data.
"
2021-08-18_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Experiment went as normal and data looks good.
"
2021-08-18_r2_DoubleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Experiment looks good and proceeded as expected.
"
2021-08-19_r1_DoubleKO_acetate,Rejected,"Experiment is ongoing. 
"
2021-08-19_r2_DoubleKO_acetate,Rejected,"Experiment is ongoing.
