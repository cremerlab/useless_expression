2021-07-19_r1_WT_glucose,Rejected,"Experiment was an instrument test and not a formal experiment. 
"
2021-07-20_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment appears to have been successful. It looks like the wild-type  strain is growing slightly faster than usual, though. 
"
2021-07-21_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment appears to have been successful with no aberrant results. 
"
2021-07-22_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"Experiment looks good, save for the growth rate of ∆flh, which is notably slower than in other experimental runs in the same conditions. The saturating  optical density is also lower for this mutant than in all other runs.
"
2021-07-23_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"All data looks good. One replicate (r1 of ∆glt) was dropped and  due to contamination and another few points of ∆mgl r3 were dropped as obvious instrument error. 
"
2021-07-25_r1_SingleKO_glucose,Accepted,"All data looks good with no reason to reject
"
2021-07-26_r1_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks okay with no obvious pathology. The steady-state phase seems  to be ""wiggly"", albeit to a small degree. I will accept this with  some consideration. REplicate 3 of the ∆dpp sample had to be dropped  due to instrument error.
"
2021-07-26_r2_SingleKO_acetate,Accepted,"Data looks good. The ∆opp strain grew notably shorter than previously, but there is no clear reason not to think that it is legitimate.
