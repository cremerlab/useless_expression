# Protein Quantification

## Description
This protocol describes a method by which one can determine the total protein
concentration in a given sample. This is typically used in conjunction with the 
RNA quantification method (`RNA_quantification.md`) to determine the RNA/Protein
ratio.


## Materials

|**Name** | **Concentration** | **Storage**| 
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) | 3 M | Room Temp |
|Copper Sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) | 1.6 % w/v | Room Temp|
|Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) | 10 mg / mL | 4 °C |


## Protocol
1. Collect ≈ 1.5 mL of cell culture at an OD<sub>600</sub> ≈ 0.4 - 0.5 and 
place in a clean eppendorf tube. 
2. Pellet the cells for 2 min at 15000xg.
3. Measure and record the OD<sub>600nm</sub> of the supernatant. 
4. Resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O and spin at 15000xg for 
30 seconds. 
5. Measure the OD<sub>600nm</sub> of teh supernatant. 
6. Resuspend pellets in 200 µL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O and transfer to a new eppendorf tube
and place on dry ice. 
7. Add 1.5 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O to the now-empty eppendorf tube (where you resuspended the pellet),
mix gently, and measure teh OD<sub>600nm</sub> of the solution.
8. Add 100 Transfer frozen cell pellets to a pre-heated 100 °C heat block
