# 2021-01-24 RNA Isolation Pilot Experiment

## Purpose
The purpose of this experiment was to validate the RNA isolate protocol for 
further transcriptomic experiments. This experiment will produce no data needed 
for further analysis. 


## Notes 
In contrast to previous runs (not documented in this repository), I was particularly
careful to use fresh tubes and tips that are (putatively) RNAase-free. 


## Results
To be added when QC results are returned.

## Protocol

1. A 3 mL culture of NCM3722 WT (`GC001`) was inoculated with a single colony 
from a fresh (< 2 week old) agar plate and was allowed to grow at 37° C for 2 - 3 
hours until an OD_600nm of ≈ 0.4.

2. The culture was transferred to two 2mL tubes (1.5 mL in each) and was pelleted
at 4° C for 10 min at 5000xg on the benchtop centrifuge.

3. The supernatant was discarded from each tube and the pellet was resuspended 
in 250 µL of water. Note that both pellets were resuspended in the same 250 µL of
water.

4. An equal volume (250 µL) of TriReagent (Trizol) was added to the tube in the 
hood and was vigorously vortexed for 30 seconds. The tube was then allowed to 
incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. 

5. An aliquot of 25 µL of chloroform was then added to the Trizol mix and vigorously 
vortexed for 30 seconds. The mixture was then allowed to rest at room temperature 
for 5 min with occasional manual inversion. From this step onward, only RNAase-free 
equipment (such as tips, tubes, water) was used. 

6. The mixuture was inverted one more time and then spun at 4 °C for 1 minute at 
16000xg.

7. The aqueous-phase (supernatant) was carefully extracted and transferred to
a clean RNA-ase free 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. This was about 500 µL.

8. An aliquot of 500 µL 200 proof ethanol was added to the isolated aqueous phase 
and mixed via pipetting. 

9. The entire volume (≈ 1 mL) was transferred to a Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate 
filter column.

10. The column was spun at 16000xg for 1 min at 4° C. The flow-through was discarded.

11. 400 µL of RNA Prep buffer was added to the column and spun for 1 min at 16000 xg 
at 4° C. The flow-through was discarded.

11. 700 µL of RNA Wash buffer (with ethanol added) was added to the column and was 
spun at 16000xg for 1 min at 4 °C. The flow-through was discarded.

12. 400 µL of RNA Wash buffer (with etahnol added) was added to the column and 
was spun at 16000xg for 1 min at 4 °C. The flow-through was discarded.

13. 15 µL of RNAase-free water was added to the column and was transferred to an 
RNAase-free 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. This was then spun for 1 min at 
16000xg at 4° C and the column was then discarded. 

14. 5 µL of the elutant was immediately removed and transferred into an RNAase-free
1.5 mL eppendorf tube for concentration determination. The remainder of the elutant
was immediately placed on dry ice.

15. 1 µL of the transferred elutant was added to the Nanodrop to quantify the 
concentration. The isolated RNA was at a concentration of **1150.0 ng / µL** with 
a 280/260 absorbance ratio of **2.80**.

16. The sample on dry-ice was then submitted to the [PAN facility](https://pan.stanford.edu/index.html) at Stanford 
for quality assessment via the Bioanalyzer.
