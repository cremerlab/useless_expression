    Data looks okay with no obvious pathology. The steady-state phase seems 
    to be "wiggly", albeit to a small degree. I will accept this with 
    some consideration. REplicate 3 of the ∆dpp sample had to be dropped 
    due to instrument error.

## Notes & Results

### Growth Rate Inference
The experiment appears to be successful in that we were able to measure steady-state
exponential-phase growth for WT and the single knockouts using the plate reader.
Doing a cursory analysis of the growth rates (meaning, a simple regression rather 
than a formal Bayesian analysis), we find the following growth rates:

| **strain** | **growth rate, µ [per hr]** |
|:--: |:--:|
|WT | 0.525 ± 0.007 |
|∆dpp | 0.563 ± 0.004 |
|∆flh | 0.456 ± 0.004 | 
|∆glt | 0.527 ± 0.004|
|∆his | 0.538 ± 0.005 |
|∆mal | 0.550 ± 0.004 |
|∆mgl | 0.568 ± 0.005 |
|∆nmp | 0.535 ± 0.004 |
|∆opp | 0.550 ± 0.006 |
|∆pot | 0.516 ± 0.005 |
|∆rbs | 0.467 ± 0.004|

### Shape of profiles
The curves look normal and as expected. The growth is slow so I was not 
able to capture much of the saturation phase.

## Protocol 
1.  Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating 3 mL of LB with a single colony from a fresh (< 2 week old) plate.
2. The LB culture was allowed to grow for 4.5 hours to saturation. 
3. A preculture was prepared by diluting the seed culture 1:1000 into 
prewarmed acetate minimal medium and allowed to grow for 11 hours at 37° C
to an OD_600nm_ of ≈ 0.4.
4. Precultues were diluted  1:20 into fresh acetate minimal medium prewarmed to 37° C.
4. A fresh 96 well plate was filled with water in blank wells. The remaining wells 
were filled with 200 µL of diluted and mixed cultures as appropriate and described in 
the section "Plate Layout".
5. The lid of the plate was loosely sealed to the plate by applying 4 strips of 
lab tape to the sides, preventing grinding of the plate while shaking. 
6. Plate was placed in the BioTek Epoch2 Plate reader and a kinetic cycle was begun 
as described in "Instrument Settings".
7. Data was saved, backed-up, exported, and analyzed using the `processing.py` and 
`analysis.py` Python scripts.
