# 2021-07-19 NCM3722 Plate Reader Test

## Purpose
This is a pilot experiment testing the recently purchased BioTek Epoch2 plate 
reader. We grew wild-type *E. coli* (NCM3722) in glucose-supplemented minimal 
medium which should have a steady-state growth rate of ≈ 0.9 per hr.  


## Materials

### Growth Media
| **Label** | **Buffer Base** | **Carbon Source & Concentration** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| glucose | N-C- + micronutrients | 10 mM glucose |

### Strains 
| **Label** | **Parent Strain**|  **Genotype** | **Location(s)**|
|:--: | :--:| :--:| :--:|
|wildtype | NCM3722 | wildtype | `GC001` |

## Notes 
* The preculture was prepared by inoculating 2 mL of glucose minimal medium with
a scrape from the freezer stock of NCM3722 + 2 µL of LB medium. The culture was 
grown at 37° C for several hours until the OD_600nm_ was ≈ 0.2. The cells were
then diluted 10 fold into prewarmed medium and partitioned into a 96 well plate
