# 2021-06-24 Growth Curves

## Purpose
This is a pilot experiment of measuring the steady-state growth rates of a 
subset of the single-operon knockouts in glucose and aceetate. Measurements 
were taken using a benchtop spectrophotometer (see `/miscellaenous/equipment`)
and were grown in a 37° C waterbath shaker.

## Materials

### Growth Media
| **Label** | **Buffer Base** | **Carbon Source & Concentration** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| glucose | N-C- + micronutrients | 10 mM glucose |
| acetate | N-C- + micronutrients | 30 mM acetate |

### Strains 
| **Label** | **Parent Strain**|  **Genotype** | **Location(s)**|

## Notes 
* Acetate-grown cells were inoculated from a preculture which had grown for ≈ 11 hours
 in N-C- + 30 mM acetate from a 1:1000 dilution from a saturated LB seed culture. Preculture
 optical densities were approximately 0.4 and were diluted 50 fold to 0.02 
* Glucose precultures were started in the morning by inoculating 2 mL of N-C- + 10 mM glucose + 0.1% LB with a single colony from an LB plate. Cultures were allowed to grow for 3 hours  to
optical densities of approximately 0.2, at which point they were diluted 10 fold 
into the measurement medium.
